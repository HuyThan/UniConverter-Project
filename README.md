UniConverter converts Ableton Projects to UniPack.
#### Q. How? 
#### A. Simple! UniConverter reads Ableton's various algorithms.

For Example, UniConverter reads algorithms to Ableton Project's Information.
#### (ex: Project's information, Sounds/LED's Position, More...)

UniConverter converts Ableton Project's Information to UniPack's Information.
Last, UniConverter trims some Sounds, LEDs of UniPack.
Also, you can edit simple information of UniPack directly!
But, you can edit detail information of UniPack on [Unitor](https://bit.do/unitor).
