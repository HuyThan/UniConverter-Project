UniConverter converts Ableton Projects to UniPack.
###### Q. How? 
###### A. Simple! UniConverter reads Ableton's various algorithms.

For Example, UniConverter reads algorithms to Ableton Project's Information.
##### (ex: Project's information, Sounds/LED's Position, More...)

UniConverter converts Ableton Project's Information to Unipack's Information.
Last, UniConverter trims some Sounds, LEDs of UniPack.
